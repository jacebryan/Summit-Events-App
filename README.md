configurable Event registration solution
* The Events App allows an institution to define an Event plus instances of the Event
* Each instance of an Event generates a unique QR code
* The Events App allows a university to define an Event Template, Event Home URL, 
Community Base URL, and an Event Instance Feed URL (the latter which uses a REST API JSON 
feed for use with dynamic updates to different web front ends)
* The Events App offers the ability to identify a count on the number of guests attending an event
* Includes: Matching Rules (hard matches + soft matches), REST API JSON feed for use with dynamic updates to 
different Web front ends, and Triggers
